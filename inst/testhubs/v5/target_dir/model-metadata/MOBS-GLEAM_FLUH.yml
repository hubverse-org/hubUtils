methods_long: "This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on the assumption that current interventions continue.  The GLEAM framework is based on a metapopulation approach in which the world is divided into geographical subpopulations.  Human mobility between subpopulations is represented on a network.  This mobility data layer identifies the numbers of individuals traveling from one sub-population to another.  The mobility network is made up of different kinds of mobility processes, from short-range commuting between nearby subpopulations to intercontinental flights.  To model short-range mobility such as commuting or car travel, we rely on databases collected from the Offices of Statistics of 30 countries on five continents.  Superimposed on the worldwide population and mobility layers is an agent-based epidemic model that defines the infection and population dynamics."
